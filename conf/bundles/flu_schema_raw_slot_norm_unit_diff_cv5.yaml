# STATUS: active -- paper experiment (5-fold CV, slot_norm + unit_diff, HA/NA, no filter)
# Cross-validation extension of flu_schema_raw_slot_norm_unit_diff.
# Inherits all settings; adds n_folds=5 for CV dataset generation.
#
# Note: This bundle must stay flat in conf/bundles/ (not in a subdirectory).
# Hydra's package resolution cannot inherit across subdirectory boundaries with
# the current config_hydra.py loader. See conf/bundles/README.md for details.
