# Flu schema-ordered (HA -> NA), raw mode with slot-specific LayerNorm, unit_diff interaction
#
# Diagnostic bundle: uses L2-normalized diff (direction only, no magnitude) to test
# whether model performance relies on diff magnitude vs direction of difference.

defaults:
  - flu_schema
  - _self_

training:
  input_mode: raw
  interaction: unit_diff
  pre_mlp_mode: slot_norm
