# Flu schema-ordered (HA -> NA), raw mode with slot-specific LayerNorm, unit_diff, H3N2 only
#
# Diagnostic bundle: uses L2-normalized diff (direction only, no magnitude) to test
# whether model performance relies on diff magnitude vs direction of difference.
# Filtered to H3N2 isolates for comparison with flu_schema_raw_slot_norm_h3n2 (diff).
