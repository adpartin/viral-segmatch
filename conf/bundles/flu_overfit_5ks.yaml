# Flu Overfitting Capacity Test Bundle (HA/NA, 5k isolates cap)
# Purpose: "capacity test" (Karpathy) — model should overfit TRAIN if pipeline is correct.
#
# This inherits HA/NA selection + max_isolates_to_process=5000 from flu_ha_na_5ks,
# and only overrides the settings that encourage memorization.

defaults:
  - flu_ha_na_5ks
  - _self_

run_suffix: null

# Dataset overrides - tiny train split to encourage memorization
dataset:
  train_ratio: 0.01
  val_ratio: 0.5

# Training overrides - many epochs, effectively disable early stopping, no dropout
training:
  epochs: 120
  patience: 120
  dropout: 0.0
  threshold_metric: null
