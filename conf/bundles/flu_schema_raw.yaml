# Flu schema-ordered dataset (HA -> NA), raw mode (no pre-MLP)
#
# This is the simplest "raw" training bundle for schema-ordered data:
# - dataset slot A/B semantics are fixed by schema_pair
# - the model receives (emb_a, emb_b) and directly applies the interaction term

defaults:
  - flu_schema
  - _self_

training:
  input_mode: raw # interaction | raw
  interaction: concat # concat | diff | prod | concat+diff+prod
  pre_mlp_mode: none
